# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "There should be no instances of `depracated` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `receive` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `depracated` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `receive` in the code."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: "main"

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: "OpenAI's Code Interpreter is a console-based application that handles JSON, uses subprocesses, and manages threads. It uses the standard Python libraries argparse, json, subprocess, threading, and sys, as well as the libraries numpy, rich, requests, webbrowser, yaml, tiktoken, tokentrim, litellm, ooba, shlex, pkg_resources, and pytest. The project supports multiple coding languages, has a command line interface, a debugging facility, uses a configuration file, uses token count mechanisms, interacts with the file system, has a testing framework, interacts with OpenAI's API or similar, has specific setups for different machine learning tasks, is interactive and responds to user commands or events, utilizes specific temporary files during code execution, uses encapsulation, and has the ability to navigate through conversational history."

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
