# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "Code should be written to be as terse as possible ie. minimise number of lines"
  - "Code should be optimised for speed using any language methods or libraries available"
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "There should be no instances of `depracated` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `receive` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `depracated` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `receive` in the code."
  - "There should be no instances of `depracated` in the code."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.

# Example:

# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: " 1 argparse, json, subprocess, threading, and sys - these standard Python libraries    
      are being used. This suggests a console-based application that handles JSON, uses   
      subprocesses, and manages threads.                                                  
    2 ast - handling Python's abstract syntax trees.                                      
    3 numpy - used for handling large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numeric   
      data.                                                                               
    4 rich - is used for the CLI's rich interface elements.                               
    5 requests, webbrowser - suggests web data interaction, possibly for updates or       
      web-based resources.                                                                
    6 yaml - implies the use of YAML formatted files, possibly used for configurations.   
    7 tiktoken, tokentrim - suggests that tokens are being generated and managed.         
    8 litellm, ooba - could imply usage of machine learning or AI modules.                
    9 shlex, pkg_resources - used for utility tasks.                                      
   10 pytest - indicates the use of a testing framework for Python.                                                                                                
  Architectural Patterns and Design                                                                                                                                           
    1 Multiple coding languages supported: preprocess_python, preprocess_shell,           
      preprocess_powershell, preprocess_javascript.                                       
    2 Presence of a command line interface: handle_undo, handle_help, handle_debug,       
      handle_reset, terminal_interface.                                                   
    3 Debugging facility: add_active_line_prints, wrap_in_try_except.                     
    4 Configuration file usage: get_config_path, get_config.                              
    5 Using token count mechanisms: count_tokens, token_cost, count_messages_tokens.      
    6 Interaction with file system: open_folder, get_conversations, embed_function.       
    7 Testing framework present: Starts with test_.                                       
    8 Interaction with OpenAI's API or similar: convert_to_openai_messages.               
    9 Has specific setups for different machine learning tasks: setup_text_llm,           
      setup_llm, setup_openai_coding_llm, setup_local_text_llm.                           
   10 Interactive and responds to user commands or events: respond.                       
   11 Utilizes specific temporary files during code execution: create_temporary_file,     
      cleanup_temporary_file.                                                             
   12 Uses encapsulation: Functions starting with get_.                                   
   13 Has the ability to navigate through conversational history:                         
      render_past_conversation, conversation_navigator.
