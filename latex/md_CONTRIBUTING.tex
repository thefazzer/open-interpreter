Thank you for your interest in contributing! As an open source project, we rely on developers like you to make conversational AI accessible.

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs and suggesting features to improving the code. We appreciate you taking the time to get involved.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Roadmap}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md1}
We are working on developing a public roadmap to provide visibility into our priorities and upcoming enhancements.

For now, our focus is on resolving issues with Code\+Llama integration and keeping the core interpreter logic simple and understandable. We want to empower non-\/coders by turning natural language into executable actions.

As such, we aim to keep the codebase simplified rather than overly complex. Our goal is to give the power of coding -\/ turning words into actions -\/ to people without coding knowledge. We welcome discussions on how to maintain this approach as we add new capabilities.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Reporting Issues}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md2}
If you encounter a bug or have a brilliant feature in mind, don\textquotesingle{}t hesitate to \href{https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/issues/new/choose}{\texttt{ open a new issue}}. To ensure a swift and effective response, please provide the following\+:

We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Here are some guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Before taking on significant code changes, please discuss your ideas on \href{https://discord.gg/6p3fD6rBVm}{\texttt{ Discord}} to ensure they align with our project vision. We want to keep the codebase simple and unintimidating for new users.
\item Fork the repository and create a new branch for your work.
\item Make changes with clear code comments explaining your approach. Try to follow existing conventions in the code.
\item Open a PR to {\ttfamily main} linking any related issues. Provide detailed context on your changes.
\item We will review PRs when possible and work with you to integrate your contribution. Please be patient as reviews take time.
\item Once approved, your code will be merged -\/ thank you for improving Open Interpreter!
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Running Your Local Fork}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md4}
Once you\textquotesingle{}ve forked the code and created a new branch for your work, you can run the fork in CLI mode by following these steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item CD into the project folder {\ttfamily /open-\/interpreter}
\item Install dependencies {\ttfamily poetry install}
\item Run the program {\ttfamily poetry run interpreter}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

After modifying the source code, you will need to do {\ttfamily poetry run interpreter} again.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Installing New Packages}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md5}
If you wish to install new dependencies into the project, please use {\ttfamily poetry add package-\/name}.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Known Issues}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md6}
For some, {\ttfamily poetry install} might hang on some dependencies. As a first step, try to run the following command in your terminal\+: ~\newline


{\ttfamily export PYTHON\+\_\+\+KEYRING\+\_\+\+BACKEND=keyring.\+backends.\+fail.\+Keyring} ~\newline


Then run {\ttfamily poetry install} again. If this doesn\textquotesingle{}t work, please join our \href{https://discord.gg/6p3fD6rBVm}{\texttt{ Discord community}} for help.\hypertarget{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Questions?}\label{md_CONTRIBUTING_autotoc_md7}
